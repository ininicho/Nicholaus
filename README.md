# TicTacToe

First project! I made a tictactoe game.

To run the project, run the runner.py file and pygame will prompt the game screen

This is a tictactoe game where players face a computer bot. The computer is implemented by 
using the minimax algorithm to find the best move to win the game. Goodluck defeating the bot!
